In this project, relevant user is defined based on the content of the users' tweet

## The jury is still out

- spark streaming vs samza

---

### Why Spark Streaming

- joins two batches that are in the same time interval

---

### Why Samza

- Table-table join
- Stream-table join
- Stream-stream join

---

Spark Streamingâ€™s updateStateByKey approach to store mismatch events cannot handle large number of events, which causes the inefficience in Spark Streaming.

---

#### Samza Stream-table Join

Common in advertising, relevance ranking, fraud detection and other domains. 

Activity events such as page views generally only include a small number of attributes, such as the ID of the viewer and the viewed items, but not detailed attributes of the viewer and the viewed items, etc.

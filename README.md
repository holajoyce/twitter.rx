# Social Media Health Ads


#### Contextual advertising by tagging of social media posts with symptoms, and joining with pharmaceutical bids

The _Social Media Health Ads_ project searches on the stream in realtime for users' symptoms, and tags posts with eligible drug companies that can provide treatments for the user.  

Drug companies are able to bid on each text for which they are eligible.

This diarrhea is caused by an infection from a bacteria called clostridium difficle or C.Diff.  The infection is difficult to treat and can be life threatening. You are at a higher risk for C.Diff if you are currently or have recently been in a hospital.  You are also at higher risk if you are currently or have recently taken any antibiotic medication. If you develop significant diarrhea while taking Nexium or after stopping it, let you doctor know right away.","tokenized_and_stemmed":["us","med","nex","proton","pump","inhibit","increas","chant","get","sev","diarrhe","thy","caus","infect","bacter","cal","clostrid","diffic","c","diff","the","difficult","tre","lif","thre","you","high","risk","cur","rec","hospit","tak","antibiot","if","develop","sign","stop","let","doct","know","right","away"]}},{"title":"Broken bones","black_box":false,"description":"There is an increased risk of developing weakened bones (osteoporosis) and broken bones (fractures) while taking medications like Nexium (proton pump inhibitors).

Your <span class=\"qt2\"><span class=\"qt3\">legs</span></span> become uncomfortable when you are lying down or sitting. Some people describe it as a creeping, crawling, tingling, or burning sensation. Moving makes your <span class=\"qt2\"><span class=\"qt3\">legs</span></span> feel better, but not for long. RLS can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep.</p><p>In most cases, there is no known cause for RLS. In other cases, RLS is caused by a disease or condition, such as anemia or pregnancy. Some medicines can also cause temporary RLS. Caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol may make symptoms worse.</p><p>Lifestyle changes, such as regular sleep habits, relaxation techniques, and moderate exercise during the day can help.  If those don't work, medicines may reduce the symptoms of RLS.</p><p>Most people with RLS also have a condition called periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMD is a condition in which a person's <span class=\"qt2\"><span class=\"qt3\">legs</span></span> twitch or jerk uncontrollably, usually during sleep.

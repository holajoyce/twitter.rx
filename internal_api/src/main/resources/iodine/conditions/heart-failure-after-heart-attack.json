Dizziness or fainting may occur when taking Nitroglycerin when you change positions, such as going from a seated or lying down position to standing because of changes in your blood pressure, which may lead to falls. This is called orthostatic hypotension. Be very careful when changing positions, especially if you're just starting to take Nitroglycerin or if changes in dosing have to be made. Talk to your doctor if you have persistent dizziness or rapid heart rate for more than 1 week.","tokenized_and_stemmed":["nitroglycerin","not","us","erectil","dysfunct","medicin","without","talk","doct","dizzy","faint","may","occ","when","tak","chang","posit","going","seat","lying","down","stand","blood","press","lead","fal","thy","cal","orthost","hypotend","be","car","espec","re","just","start","dos","mad","persist","rapid","heart","rat","week"]}},{"title":"Tolerance","black_box":false,"description":"Your body can get used to Nitroglycerin and the same amount of medicine no longer works as well as it used to, also known as tolerance.

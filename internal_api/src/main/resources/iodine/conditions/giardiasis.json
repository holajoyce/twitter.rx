You can also get it if you're exposed to human feces (poop) through sexual contact.</p><p>The risk of getting giardia is higher for travelers to countries where it is common, people in child care settings, and those who drink untreated water.</p><p>Diarrhea is the main symptom of giardia infection. Others include</p><ul><li> Passing gas</li><li> Greasy stools</li><li> Stomach cramps</li><li> Upset stomach or nausea </li></ul><p>These symptoms may lead to weight loss and loss of body fluids. Some people have no symptoms at all. Symptoms of infection often last two to six weeks. Stool sample tests can diagnose it. You often need to collect several samples to test. Doctors use several drugs to treat it. </p><p>The best way to prevent giardia infection is to practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing.

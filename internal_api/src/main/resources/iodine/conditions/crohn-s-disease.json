Understand what triggers flares by keeping a food diary and consider an elimination diet.  Reducing/eliminating gluten (wheat, oats, etc.) and dairy can have a significant impact.  The Paleo Diet, particularly the Anti-Inflammatory Paleo Diet, might be worth considering.  Supplements can also be important, particularly Vitamin D, Folic Acid and B12.  Other supplements worth considering include Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), Vitamin C, concentrated mineral drops, liquid calcium citrate, and more.  Probiotics can be hit or miss.  Typically people with ulcerative colitis benefit more from probiotics than people with Crohn's.  Supplements to boost energy may also be beneficial, such as the supplements used to treat chronic fatigue syndrome.  Get plenty of sleep and reduce stress.  Exercise is also particularly important for imroving health and mood.  Yoga has helped many people too.","tempUserId":"7a2gj37kq7vx","entryId":"jro3lsef6bq1"},{"_id":"555370ed6493310e000f6889","conditionName":"Crohn's disease","question":"Besides medications, what else has worked for you?","tip":"Diet, Supplements, Exercise, Yoga, Stress Reduction","tempUserId":"7a2gj37kq7vx","entryId":"nsp28j4u01d7"}],"flags":{"compare-table":true,"side-effect-viz":true,"images":true},"condition":{"description":"<p><span class=\"qt0\"><span class=\"qt2\">Crohn</span></span><span class=\"qt2\">'s </span><span class=\"qt1\"><span class=\"qt2\">disease</span></span> causes inflammation of the digestive system.

Understand what triggers flares by keeping a food diary and consider an elimination diet.  Reducing/eliminating gluten (wheat, oats, etc.) and dairy can have a significant impact.  The Paleo Diet, particularly the Anti-Inflammatory Paleo Diet, might be worth considering.  Supplements can also be important, particularly Vitamin D, Folic Acid and B12.  Other supplements worth considering include Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), Vitamin C, concentrated mineral drops, liquid calcium citrate, and more.  Probiotics can be hit or miss.  Typically people with ulcerative colitis benefit more from probiotics than people with Crohn's.  Supplements to boost energy may also be beneficial, such as the supplements used to treat chronic fatigue syndrome.  Get plenty of sleep and reduce stress.  Exercise is also particularly important for imroving health and mood.  Yoga has helped many people too.","tempUserId":"7a2gj37kq7vx","entryId":"jro3lsef6bq1"},{"_id":"555370ed6493310e000f6889","conditionName":"Crohn's disease","question":"Besides medications, what else has worked for you?","tip":"Diet, Supplements, Exercise, Yoga, Stress Reduction","tempUserId":"7a2gj37kq7vx","entryId":"nsp28j4u01d7"}],"flash":null,"session":{"serverSide":true,"hasUser":false},"urlPrefix":"https://www.iodine.com"}

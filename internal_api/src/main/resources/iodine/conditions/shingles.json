After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years.  As you get older, the virus may reappear as <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span>. Although it is most common in people over age 50, anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk.</p><p>You can't catch <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span> from someone who has it.  However, if you have a <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span> rash, you can pass the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox.  This would usually be a child, who could get chickenpox instead of <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span>.  The virus spreads through direct contact with the rash, and cannot spread through the air.</p><p>Early signs of <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span> include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching, usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Rashes or blisters appear anywhere from one to 14 days later. If <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span> appears on your face, it may affect your vision or hearing. The pain of <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span> may last for weeks, months, or even years after the blisters have healed. </p><p>There is no cure for <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span>. Early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain.</p><p>A vaccine may prevent <span class=\"qt0\">shingles</span> or lessen its effects.  The vaccine is recommended for people 60 or over.  In some cases doctors may give it to people ages 50 to 59.</p><p>NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</p>","indications":["herpes zoster","shingles","herpes zoster (shingles)

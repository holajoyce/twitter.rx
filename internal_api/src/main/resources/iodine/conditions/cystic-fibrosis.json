It affects mostly your lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses and sex organs.  CF causes your mucus to be thick and sticky. The mucus clogs the lungs, causing breathing problems and making it easy for bacteria to grow. This can lead to problems such as repeated lung infections and lung damage. </p><p>The symptoms and severity of CF vary widely. Some people have serious problems from birth. Others have a milder version of the disease that doesn't show up until they are teens or young adults. </p><p>Although there is no cure for CF, treatments have improved greatly in recent years. Until the 1980s, most deaths from CF occurred in children and teenagers. Today, with improved treatments, some people who have CF are living into their forties, fifties, or older.</p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>","indications":["cystic fibrosis"],"name":"Cystic fibrosis","symptoms":null,"synonyms":["CF"],"tags":["Lung and respiratory problems"]},"indications":["Cystic fibrosis"],"drugs":[{"carousel_items":["Take the medication exactly how your doctor tells you to.","Can cause diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.","Space out any antacids with magnesium or aluminum by at least 2 hours.","Can take with or without food."],"generic_available":true,"use_generic_as_url":true,"name_generic":"Azithromycin","basics":{"benefits_moa":"Azithromycin is an antibiotic.

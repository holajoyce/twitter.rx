They may also have problems such as depression, sleep problems, or trouble chewing, swallowing, or speaking.</p><p>There is no lab test for PD, so it can be difficult to diagnose.  Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.</p><p>PD usually begins around age 60, but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases. With DBS, electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain. They send electrical pulses to stimulate the parts of the brain that control movement.</p><p>NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p>","indications":["parkinson's

Plaque is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. That limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.</p><p><span class=\"qt0\">Atherosclerosis</span> can lead to serious problems, including</p><ul><li>Coronary artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your heart. When they are blocked, you can suffer angina or a heart attack.</li><li>Carotid artery disease. These arteries supply blood to your brain. When they are blocked you can suffer a stroke.</li><li>Peripheral arterial disease. These arteries are in your arms, legs and pelvis. When they are blocked, you can suffer from numbness, pain and sometimes infections.</li></ul><p><span class=\"qt0\">Atherosclerosis</span> usually doesn't cause symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have it until they have a medical emergency.</p><p>A physical exam, imaging, and other diagnostic tests can tell if you have it. Medicines can slow the progress of plaque buildup. Your doctor may also recommend procedures such as angioplasty to open the arteries, or surgery on the coronary or carotid arteries. Lifestyle changes can also help. These include following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, and managing stress. </p><p>NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>","indications":["hardened arteries (atherosclerosis)","heart and blood vessel disease","heart and blood vessel disease prevention"],"name":"Atherosclerosis","symptoms":null,"synonyms":["Hardened arteries"],"tags":["Cardiovascular disease"]},"indications":["Hardened arteries (atherosclerosis)","Heart and blood vessel disease prevention","Heart and blood vessel disease"],"drugs":[{"carousel_items":["Lowers bad cholesterol and triglycerides, and raises good cholesterol.","Don't take antacids for at least 2 hours before and after taking this medicine.","Tell your doctor if you develop sudden muscle pain, fever, or weakness.","Tell your doctor if you notice dark urine or yellowing of the eyes or skin."],"generic_available":false,"use_generic_as_url":false,"what_to_expect":{"clock":[{"onset":168,"disease_state":null,"halflife":19,"time_to_peak":4,"duration":0,"formulation":"Tablet","tip":null,"indication":null,"ethnicity":null,"age":null}],"timeline":[{"indication":"High cholesterol","effects":[{"name":"Starts to kick in","range":[1,1]},{"name":"Full effects","range":[2,2]}],"side_effects":[{"name":"Nausea","range":[1,2],"less_common":false},{"name":"Stomach problems","range":[1,2],"less_common":false},{"name":"Headache","range":[1,2],"less_common":false},{"name":"Dizziness","range":[1,2],"less_common":false},{"name":"Muscle pain","range":[1,4],"less_common":true},{"name":"Liver problems","range":[2,4],"less_common":true}]}]},"name_generic":"Rosuvastatin","basics":{"benefits_moa":"Crestor is cholesterol-lowering medicine called a statin.

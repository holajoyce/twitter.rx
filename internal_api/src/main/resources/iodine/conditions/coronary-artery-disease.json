It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.</p><p>CAD happens when the <span class=\"qt1\">arteries</span> that supply blood to <span class=\"qt0\">heart</span> muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the <span class=\"qt1\">arteries</span>. As a result, the <span class=\"qt0\">heart</span> muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a <span class=\"qt0\">heart</span> attack.

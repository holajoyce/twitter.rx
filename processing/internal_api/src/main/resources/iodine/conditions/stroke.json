Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.   There are two kinds of <span class=\"qt0\">stroke</span>. The more common kind, called ischemic <span class=\"qt0\">stroke</span>, is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind, called hemorrhagic <span class=\"qt0\">stroke</span>, is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.   <span class=\"qt0\">\"Mini-strokes\"</span> or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), occur when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted.</p><p>Symptoms of <span class=\"qt0\">stroke</span> are </p><ul><li>Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)</li><li>Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech</li><li>Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes</li><li>Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination</li><li>Sudden severe headache with no known cause</li></ul><p>If you have any of these symptoms, you must get to a hospital quickly to begin treatment.

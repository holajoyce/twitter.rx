Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.</p><p>Most people with prediabetes don't have any symptoms. Your doctor can test your blood to find out if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal. If you are 45 years old or older, your doctor may recommend that you be tested for prediabetes, especially if you are overweight.</p><p>Losing weight - at least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weight - can prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. That's 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. You can lose weight by cutting down on the amount of calories and fat you eat and being physically active at least 30 minutes a day. Being physically active makes your body's insulin work better. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to help control the amount of glucose in your blood.</p><p>NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>","indications":["pre-diabetes"],"name":"Prediabetes","symptoms":null,"synonyms":["Impaired glucose tolerance"],"tags":["Endocrine disorders"]},"indications":["Pre-diabetes"],"drugs":[{"carousel_items":["Takes several weeks to see full effect on blood sugar control.","Can cause weight gain, headache, and fluid retention.","Tell your doctor about any mental confusion, persistent abdominal pain, dark urine, yellowing of eyes/skin, or easy bruising.","Not recommended for patients with certain heart problems.","Check your blood sugar regularly."],"generic_available":true,"use_generic_as_url":false,"what_to_expect":{"clock":[{"onset":672,"disease_state":null,"halflife":20,"time_to_peak":0,"duration":0,"formulation":"Tablet","tip":null,"indication":null,"ethnicity":null,"age":null}],"timeline":[{"indication":"Improves blood sugar levels","effects":[{"name":"Starts to kick in","range":[1,1]},{"name":"Full effects","range":[2,2]}],"side_effects":[{"name":"Headache","range":[1,2],"less_common":false},{"name":"Common cold symptoms","range":[1,2],"less_common":false},{"name":"Low blood sugar","range":[1,2],"less_common":true},{"name":"Swelling","range":[0,4],"less_common":true},{"name":"Heart problems","range":[0,4],"less_common":true}]}]},"name_generic":"Pioglitazone","basics":{"benefits_moa":"Actos is an anti-diabetic drug.

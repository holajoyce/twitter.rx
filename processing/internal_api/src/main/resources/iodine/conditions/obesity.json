It is different from being <span class=\"qt0\">overweight</span>, which means weighing too much.  The weight may come from muscle, bone, <span class=\"qt0\">fat</span>, and/or body water.  Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. </p><p><span class=\"qt0\">Obesity</span> occurs over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-<span class=\"qt0\">fat</span> foods, and not being physically active. </p><p>Being obese increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you are obese, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases.

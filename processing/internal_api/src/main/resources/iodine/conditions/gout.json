It causes swollen, red, hot and stiff joints.</p><p><span class=\"qt0\">Gout</span> happens when uric acid builds up in your body.  Uric acid comes from the breakdown of substances called purines. Purines are in your body's tissues and in foods, such as liver, dried beans and peas, and anchovies. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood. It passes through the kidneys and out of the body in urine. But sometimes uric acid can build up and form needle-like crystals. When they form in your joints, it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.</p><p>Often, <span class=\"qt0\">gout</span> first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles, heels, knees, wrists, fingers, and elbows.

and lower the amount of red meat intake, stay away from shellfish as much as possible. Fish, chicken and turkey are great options. When eating fish try to stick to lighter color fishes(tuna is high agitators for gout) stay away from alcohol(you can drink but not too much or to often). Stay away from too much salt and also beans. You will be fine. Work out, that helps.

One problem is premature ovarian failure, in which the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause.  In another,  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),   the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or may not release a healthy egg.</p><p>About a third of the time, <span class=\"qt1\">infertility</span> is because of a problem with the woman. One third of the time, it is a problem with the man. Sometimes no cause can be found.</p><p>If you suspect you are infertile, see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause, treatments may include medicines, surgery, or assisted reproductive technologies.

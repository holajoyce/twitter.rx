The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.</p><p>Symptoms of <span class=\"qt1\">herpes</span> are called outbreaks.  You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal.  Sometimes people do not know they have <span class=\"qt1\">herpes</span> because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms.

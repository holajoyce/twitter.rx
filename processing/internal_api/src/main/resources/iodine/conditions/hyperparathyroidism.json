Though their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous.</p><p>If your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone, it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra PTH, you have <span class=\"qt0\">hyperparathyroidism</span>, and your blood calcium rises. In many cases, a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or, the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely, the cause is cancer.</p><p>If you do not have enough PTH, you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous. Causes include injury to the glands, endocrine disorders, or genetic conditions. Treatment is aimed at restoring the balance of calcium and phosphorous.</p><p>NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>","indications":["hyperparathyroidism","hyperparathyroidism from kidney disease","secondary hyperparathyroidism"],"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","symptoms":null,"synonyms":null,"tags":["Endocrine disorders"]},"indications":["Hyperparathyroidism from kidney disease","Secondary hyperparathyroidism","Hyperparathyroidism"],"drugs":[{"carousel_items":["Don't take other forms of vitamin D unless told to by your doctor.","Avoid antacids containing magnesium.","Can be given as a capsule or as a shot.","Can cause swelling in the legs, weakness, nausea and vomiting."],"generic_available":true,"use_generic_as_url":false,"name_generic":"Doxercalciferol","basics":{"benefits_moa":"Hectorol is a synthetic form of Vitamin D2.

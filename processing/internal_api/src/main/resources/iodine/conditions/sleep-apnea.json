It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span>. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span> <span class=\"qt1\">apnea</span> often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span> <span class=\"qt1\">apnea</span>.</p><p>You are more at risk for <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span> <span class=\"qt1\">apnea</span> if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways.  Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.</p><p>Doctors diagnose <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span> <span class=\"qt1\">apnea</span> based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span> study results.</p><p>When your <span class=\"qt0\">sleep</span> is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day.

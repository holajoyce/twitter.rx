It is not a specific disease. People with <span class=\"qt0\">dementia</span> may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities, such as getting dressed or eating. They may lose their ability to solve problems or control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They may become agitated or see things that are not there. </p><p>Memory loss is a common symptom of <span class=\"qt0\">dementia</span>. However, memory loss by itself does not mean you have <span class=\"qt0\">dementia</span>.
